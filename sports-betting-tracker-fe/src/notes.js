// When clicking on one of the bettor buttons the text should change from "add bet" or whatever it is to close.

// When you have a component open like add bet and then click add payment it closes the component rather than switching the component. This only happens if you do it on the same bettor if you do it across bettor it
// switches the component correctly. Has something to do with the current select bettor code. Clicking a different component of the same better is taking the selectedBettor back to null instead of it remaining the same
// --- need to get it to check both the currently selectedBettor, but also the component being selected.
